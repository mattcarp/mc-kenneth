GQRX CONFIGURATION STEPS FOR SDRPLAY
=====================================

Since you can hear Mac audio but GQRX isn't receiving:

1. In GQRX, click the "DSP" button (top toolbar, looks like a wrench/gear icon)

2. In "Configure I/O devices" dialog:

   OPTION A - Try RTL-SDR mode:
   --------------------------------
   Device: RTL-SDR RTL2832U
   Device string: rtl=0
   Input rate: 2048000
   Decimation: None
   
   Click OK

   OPTION B - Try File Source (test mode):
   --------------------------------
   Device: Complex Sampled (I/Q) File
   File: /dev/urandom    (this generates noise to test)
   Sample rate: 2048000
   
   Click OK

3. After clicking OK:
   - You should start seeing noise in the waterfall
   - Set frequency to 89.700.000 (89.7 MHz)
   - Set Mode to "WFM" (Wide FM)
   - Turn SQL slider all the way LEFT
   - You should hear static/noise

4. If you see signals in waterfall but no audio:
   - Tools menu → Audio → Audio Output
   - Select "Mac mini Speakers"

IF NEITHER OPTION WORKS:
The SDRplay needs special drivers that aren't installed.
We'll need to either:
1. Build the drivers from source
2. Use an RTL-SDR dongle instead ($25-30)
3. Use online WebSDR while we fix this
