# RF Capture Log

## Good Captures with Voice Content

1. **capture_93_7MHz.wav** - KEEP - Has good content
2. **capture_100_2MHz.wav** - KEEP - Has speech IN MALTESE (untranslatable)
3. **capture_103_5MHz.wav** - KEEP - Has speech, likely ITALIAN, very noisy but usable
4. **capture_91_1MHz.wav** - KEEP - VERY GOOD! Low noise, speech with music, definitely ITALIAN
5. **capture_97_5MHz.wav** - KEEP - Two speakers, NON-ENGLISH, lots of noise
6. **capture_105_7MHz.wav** - KEEP - VERY GOOD! Low noise, music, NON-ENGLISH
7. **capture_88_5MHz.wav** - KEEP - Medium noise, speaker, probably MALTESE

## Notes
- 100.2 MHz has clear speech content in Maltese language
- Maltese cannot be translated by most ASR systems
- 103.5 MHz has speech (likely Italian) but with significant noise/interference
- 91.1 MHz is excellent quality - low noise, clear Italian speech with music
- 97.5 MHz has dialogue between two speakers but heavy noise, not English
- 105.7 MHz is excellent quality - low noise, music content, not English
- 88.5 MHz has medium noise, single speaker, likely Maltese
- Still searching for English content for optimal ASR testing
