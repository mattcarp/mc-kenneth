# 📋 KENNETH PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## RF Forensics Platform with S2S Emotional Intelligence

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** In Development  
**Location:** Malta (Mediterranean)

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kenneth is an emotionally-intelligent RF forensics platform that monitors maritime and aviation frequencies to:
1. **Detect threats** through voice stress and behavioral analysis
2. **Save lives** by identifying both explicit and implicit distress signals

The integration of OpenAI's Speech-to-Speech (S2S) technology transforms Kenneth from a passive listening system into an active emotional intelligence platform capable of detecting panic, exhaustion, and fear that traditional transcription misses.

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Current Limitations in RF Monitoring:
- **Traditional systems miss emotional context** - "I'm fine" said while crying
- **Transcription loses critical information** - breathing patterns, voice stress
- **Language barriers** - Malta's multilingual environment (Maltese/English/Italian/Arabic)
- **Delayed response** - Human operators can't monitor all frequencies 24/7
- **Implicit distress ignored** - No words doesn't mean no emergency

### Real-World Scenarios We Must Address:
1. **Fisherman taking on water** - Heavy breathing, no explicit distress call
2. **Pilot experiencing hypoxia** - Slurred speech, confusion
3. **Yacht in distress** - Crying children in background
4. **Criminal coordination** - Normal words with threatening tone
5. **Medical emergency** - Labored breathing, weakening voice

---

## 3. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

### Kenneth S2S Architecture:
```
RF Signal → SDR++ → Audio → S2S Analysis → Emotional Intelligence → Alert
```

### Key Innovations:
- **Emotion Detection**: Stress, panic, exhaustion, confusion
- **Accent Preservation**: Maintains Maltese, Arabic, Italian nuances
- **Real-time Processing**: <500ms from capture to alert
- **Multi-agent System**: Specialized agents for different emergencies
- **No transcription loss**: Direct audio-to-understanding

## 8. USER STORIES

### Critical Path Stories

1. **As a Coast Guard operator, I need to be alerted when someone is in distress even if they don't explicitly say so, so that I can respond to emergencies where the person is unable to call for help properly.**

2. **As an Air Traffic Controller, I need to detect when a pilot is becoming hypoxic or disoriented, so that I can provide immediate assistance before the situation becomes critical.**

3. **As a Security Analyst, I need to detect threatening behavior through voice stress analysis, so that I can identify potential criminal activity before it occurs.**

### Enhancement Stories

4. **As an Emergency Coordinator, I need to see emotion levels across all monitored frequencies on a map, so that I can allocate resources to the highest priority incidents.**

5. **As a System Administrator, I need to configure emotion detection thresholds, so that I can tune the system for different operational scenarios.**
