# RF DIGITAL FORENSICS TOOLKIT - MISSION STATEMENT

## PROJECT IDENTITY - KENNETH

**THE IMMUTABLE CORE:**
- **Name:** Kenneth
- **Mission:** Goals: 1. Detect bad actors, 2. Help those in distress

These two elements define the project and must NEVER be changed in any UI, demo, or documentation.

## THE DUAL MISSION

### 🚨 MISSION 1: CATCH BAD GUYS
**Objective:** Detect and prevent harm before it happens

**What We Listen For:**
- Threatening language or intent to harm
- Criminal coordination or planning  
- Illegal activities being discussed
- Suspicious patterns of communication
- Coded language indicating malicious intent

**Detection Methods:**
- Sentiment analysis (anger, aggression, threat indicators)
- Keyword detection across all languages
- Pattern recognition (unusual timing, frequency hopping)
- Voice stress analysis
- Behavioral anomalies

### 🆘 MISSION 2: SAVE LIVES
**Objective:** Find people in distress and get them help - BEYOND just emergency calls

**What We Listen For:**

**EXPLICIT DISTRESS:**
- Direct emergency calls (MAYDAY, PAN-PAN, SOS)
- Medical emergencies being described
- "Help" in any language or dialect

**IMPLICIT DISTRESS PATTERNS:**
- **Confusion/Disorientation:** "Where am I?", "I can't find...", repeated location requests
- **Exhaustion:** Slurred speech, long pauses, breathing difficulties in transmission
- **Panic Without Words:** Heavy breathing, crying, whimpering, screaming
- **Gradual Deterioration:** Voice getting weaker over multiple transmissions
- **Mechanical Problems:** "Engine won't start", "Taking on water", "Losing altitude"
- **Resource Depletion:** "Running out of fuel/food/water/battery"
- **Isolation Indicators:** "Haven't seen anyone in days", "Radio is my only contact"

**BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES:**
- **Sudden Silence:** Regular check-ins that suddenly stop
- **Off-Schedule Transmissions:** Fishing boat calling at 3am instead of usual 6pm
- **Location Drift:** Vessel/person reporting from unexpected coordinates
- **Repeated Attempts:** Same message sent multiple times (desperation)
- **Channel Hopping:** Trying multiple frequencies to find help
- **Weakening Signal:** Progressive signal degradation (dying battery/increasing distance)

**INDIRECT INDICATORS:**
- **Child's Voice:** Children on maritime/aviation frequencies
- **Wrong Language:** Tourist speaking English on local-only frequency
- **Code Words:** Family/cultural distress phrases ("red sunset" = danger)
- **Background Sounds:** Alarms, water sounds, wind/storm, crying children
- **Time Criticality:** "Before dark", "High tide coming", "Storm approaching"

**PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS:**
- **Bargaining:** "If someone can hear this..."
- **Resignation:** "This might be my last transmission"
- **Anger/Frustration:** Escalating emotional state over time
- **Confusion:** Repeating questions, forgetting previous exchanges
- **Hypothermia Signs:** Slurred speech, illogical statements
- **Dehydration/Heatstroke:** Confusion, aggression, disorientation

**SOCIAL DISTRESS:**
- **Domestic Violence:** Coded requests, whispered transmissions
- **Human Trafficking:** Multiple voices, fearful tones, controlled speech
- **Elderly Isolation:** Confusion about technology, health concerns
- **Mental Health Crisis:** Suicidal ideation, paranoid behavior
- **Lost Children:** Young voices on adult frequencies

**TECHNICAL INDICATORS:**
- **Morse Code SOS:** Even if voice comms work
- **EPIRB/PLB Activation:** 406 MHz beacon detection
- **AIS Anomalies:** Vessel track showing circles, drift, or stoppage
- **Transponder Issues:** Aircraft squawking 7700 (emergency)
- **DSC Distress:** Digital Selective Calling automated alerts

**Detection Methods:**
- **AI Sentiment Analysis:** Fear, panic, desperation, resignation
- **Voice Biometrics:** Stress, fatigue, medical conditions
- **Pattern Recognition:** Deviation from normal behavior
- **Acoustic Analysis:** Background sound classification
- **Temporal Analysis:** Transmission timing/frequency changes
- **Cross-Reference:** Multiple weak indicators = strong signal
- **Predictive Modeling:** "This pattern leads to emergency in 2 hours"

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Language Agnostic Detection
1. **Start with Maltese** (hardest case) → Master all languages
2. **Multi-language pipeline:**
   - RF Capture (HackRF)
   - Noise Removal (ElevenLabs)
   - Transcription (Whisper/Multiple engines)
   - Translation (to English for analysis)
   - Sentiment/Intent Analysis
   - Alert Generation

### Coverage
- **Frequency Range:** 1 MHz - 6 GHz (full HackRF spectrum)
- **Location:** Malta (Mediterranean crossroads)
- **Languages:** ALL (starting with Maltese, Arabic, Italian, English)
- **Sources:** 
  - Marine VHF (156-162 MHz)
  - Aviation (108-137 MHz)
  - Emergency frequencies (121.5, 243.0, 406 MHz)
  - Amateur radio bands
  - Commercial radio (FM/AM)
  - Cellular bands
  - Satellite downlinks

### Alert System
**Phase 1:** SMS to operator
**Phase 2:** Multi-channel alerts (SMS, email, API webhooks)
**Phase 3:** Direct integration with emergency services

## WHY THIS MATTERS

From our position in Malta, we sit at the crossroads of:
- Mediterranean maritime traffic
- North Africa ↔ Europe migration routes  
- Major shipping lanes
- International aviation corridors

**We can hear:**
- Boats in distress before they sink
- People calling for help in remote areas
- Criminal activities being planned
- Emergency beacons that others might miss

**We can save lives and stop bad things from happening.**

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Bad Guy Detection
- Threats identified before execution
- Criminal activities disrupted
- Response time < 5 minutes from detection

### Life Saving
- Distress calls responded to
- People rescued
- Emergency response time reduced
- Lives saved

## ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

1. **Privacy:** We don't record or store routine communications
2. **Focus:** Only flag threats and emergencies
3. **Transparency:** Clear documentation of capabilities
4. **Legal:** Comply with all local/international laws
5. **Humanitarian:** Life-saving always takes priority

## THE VISION

Build a system that can:
- Understand a cry for help in ANY language
- Detect malicious intent regardless of code words
- Work through noise, interference, and weak signals
- Provide actionable intelligence in real-time
- Scale from Malta to global deployment

**Starting with the hardest problem (Maltese in noisy RF) means we build something that works EVERYWHERE.**

---

*"If we can detect a Maltese fisherman in distress through static, we can detect anything."*
*"If we can identify threats in Arabic/Maltese code-switching, we can identify threats anywhere."*

This is not mass surveillance. This is targeted detection of:
1. **People who want to hurt others**
2. **People who need help**

Everything else is noise we ignore.
